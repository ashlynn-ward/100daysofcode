Subject: Regarding the Curious Case of the Missing Garden Gnome

Dear Luke
,

I am writing to you today about a rather perplexing incident that occurred last Tuesday, specifically around 3:17 PM. My prized garden gnome, Bartholomew, a distinguished figure with a bright red hat and a slightly chipped beard, mysteriously vanished from his usual perch beside the petunias.

Bartholomew has been a fixture in my garden for nearly seven years, providing silent companionship and, I assume, excellent pest control. His absence has left a noticeable void, not just in the flowerbed, but in my spirit. The squirrels seem bolder, the robins less melodious, and even the weeds appear to be growing with an unprecedented sense of triumph.

I have thoroughly searched the premises, including the compost bin (a risky maneuver), under the bird bath, and even inside the emergency rain barrel. There are no signs of a struggle, no tiny gnome footprints leading into the great unknown, just an empty patch of earth where Bartholomew once stood sentinel.

While I understand this may seem trivial in the grand scheme of things, one grows quite fond of a gnome with such character. Any information or insight you might have into this peculiar disappearance would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps he's merely on a sabbatical, exploring the vast wilderness of the neighboring lawn? One can only hope.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this most unusual matter.

Sincerely,

A Bewildered Gardener
